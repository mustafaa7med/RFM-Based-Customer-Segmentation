# RFM-Based Customer Segmentation for Strategic Insights

This project focuses on customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a proven method for identifying and categorizing customers based on their purchasing behavior. By assigning scores to each RFM metric and classifying customers into meaningful segments (e.g., Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, Lost), businesses can optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and drive revenue growth.

### Questions that can be answered through the project:

- Who are our most valuable customers?
- Which customers are at risk of churning?
- Which customers used to buy frequently but have stopped?
- Which customers should receive re-engagement campaigns?
- Which customers are most likely to respond to upsell or cross-sell offers?
- How can we optimize loyalty programs for different customer segments?

## Finding Number of Customers, Orders, and Average Paid Price per Country

```sql
-- Finding # of customers, # of orders and the avg paid price per country 
  SELECT  DISTINCT country                           AS country,
          COUNT(DISTINCT invoice)                    AS Number_Of_Orders,
          COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)                AS Number_Of_Customers,
          ROUND(AVG(price * quantity), 2)            AS Avg_Payment
    FROM  tableretail
GROUP BY  1
ORDER BY  2 DESC,		
          3 DESC;
```
***Output:***
